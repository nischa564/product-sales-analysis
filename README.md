### Context
Predicting the number of sales is highly important for sellers in order to make informed decisions, optimize resources and ensure the sustainability and growth of their business. Accurate sales predictions help in managing inventory levels, ensuring the right products are available at the right time, avoiding overstock or stockouts and reducing carrying costs. Sellers can also plan marketing and advertising strategies effectively, allocating budgets to the most promising channels and campaigns.
